# Space Engineers Helper (version)
## About Project
If you found this project, you are probably Space Engineer and there is no point of explaining you what Space Engineers actually is... We started this project right after release of SE2, but there is no survival yet, so we started playing SE1 together again. You know that situation, you are building some kind of solar farm, base upgrade or any kind of vehicle, you have opened Excel on second monitor or you are playing with keyboard, mouse, paper and pen. You want to calculate every thing that you can, you have to plan material production for every block, but you can not add every item into **build planner**. 
So here you are, you found open source project that allows you to add every block that is actually in game into list of your build, you can multiply that build or you can just add some more... This tool is here to help you plan production of exact amount of steel plates, battery cells etc..
Do you want to build a mining ship, but you are not sure if it will fly? Well, we are planing to add this tool too, it will count you how many thrusters you need to add to the ship, but this is future...
## Develop project with us!
It's open source, you can download dockerfile and the project, build it and run it on your machine. You can add API endpoints and add mods to game GUI, like, there are no bad ideas, just the good one and the better one. 
We are using React.js on the front end and the Python FastAPI on the backend, for the database we are using MariaDB.
