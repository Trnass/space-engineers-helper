# Space Engineers Helper (version)
## About the Project
If you found this project, you are probably a Space Engineer, so there is no need to explain what Space Engineers actually is. We started this project right after the release of SE2, but since there is no survival mode yet, we decided to play SE1 together again.

You know the situation: you’re building a solar farm, upgrading your base, or designing a new vehicle. You have Excel open on your second monitor, or you’re calculating things manually with a keyboard, mouse, paper, and pen. You want to plan every detail, calculating the exact amount of materials needed for every block. However, you can’t add every item to the Build Planner.

Well, here you are—you found an open-source project that allows you to add every block currently available in the game to your build list. You can duplicate your builds or modify them as needed. This tool helps you plan the exact number of steel plates, battery cells, and other materials required for your constructions.

Do you want to build a mining ship but aren’t sure if it will fly? We’re planning to add a tool for that as well! It will calculate how many thrusters your ship needs. But that’s for the future…
## Develop project with us!
This is an open-source project! You can download the Dockerfile, build the project, and run it on your machine. You can also contribute by adding API endpoints or integrating mods into the game’s GUI. There are no bad ideas—just good ones and even better ones!

We’re using React.js for the frontend, Python FastAPI for the backend, and MariaDB as the database.
